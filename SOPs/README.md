This directory contains the following SOP documentation <br>
- The ARMS Molecular SOPs. The ARMS-MBON data that were taken during the ASSEMBLE Plus years of the projects, that is from 2018 until the summer of 2022, were processed with these SOPs. From 2022 onwards, ARMS-MBON became part of [EMO BON](https://www.embrc.eu/emo-bon) and the SOPs followed for the molecular (sequencing) work will be those of EMO BON. 
- The Smithsonian Global ARMS standard operating procedures (SOPs) in a zip file (taken from http://www.oceanarms.org/protocols-overview, which is often very slow to respond). These cover all aspects of ARMS work - from constructing the units to processing them upon retrieval - and are valid for all ARMS-MBON samples and data, whether from before or after joining EMO BON. Note that some additions to these SOPs are given in the [ARMS-MBON Handbook](https://github.com/arms-mbon/documentation/tree/main/Handbook). 

The SOPs followed by ARMS-MBON are those Smithsonian ones, with some exceptions as outlined in the [Handbook](https://github.com/arms-mbon/documentation/tree/main/Handbook).
