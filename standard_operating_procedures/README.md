This directory contains documentation for historical reference related to the ARMS-MBON project. As of 2024, the EMO BON Handbook serves as the primary reference for all molecular (sequencing) work and standard operating procedures (SOPs). The SOPs in this repository, including those developed by the Smithsonian and ARMS-MBON, are no longer in active use but remain available for archival purposes. <br>

- ARMS Molecular SOPs (Historical)
The ARMS Molecular SOPs were applied to data collected from 2018 to summer 2022, during the ASSEMBLE Plus years of the projects. Some additional details and modifications to these SOPs are provided in the ARMS-MBON Handbook. These SOPs are no longer followed as of 2022.

-Smithsonian Global ARMS SOPs
This zip file contains the Smithsonian Global ARMS standard operating procedures (taken from [here](https://naturalhistory.si.edu/research/global-arms-program)), which cover all aspects of ARMS work â€“ from constructing units to processing them upon retrieval. These SOPs were valid for ARMS-MBON samples and data collected prior to mid-2022 during the ASSEMBLE Plus project years. Although superseded, these documents provide foundational context and are included here for historical reference. 

The documents in this repository, including the Smithsonian Global ARMS SOPs and ARMS-MBON Molecular SOPs, are archival materials and should only be used for historical reference.

The [ARMS Handbook](https://github.com/arms-mbon/documentation/tree/main/armsmbon_handbook) and [EMO BON Handbook](https://www.embrc.eu/newsroom/publications/emo-bon-handbook-2024) are inspired from the Smithsonian Global ARMS SOPs. From 2022 onwards, ARMS-MBON became part of [EMO BON](https://www.embrc.eu/emo-bon) and the SOPs followed for the molecular (sequencing) work will be those of EMO BON.  For current work, refer exclusively to the [EMO BON Handbook](https://www.embrc.eu/newsroom/publications/emo-bon-handbook-2024), which outlines all valid procedures, including the new MSOP.
