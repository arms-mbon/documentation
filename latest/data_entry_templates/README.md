These are the various Word templates to use for ARMS data and sample collecting. Note that ARMS-MBON became part of [EMO BON](https://www.embrc.eu/emo-bon) in the summer of 2022, and some of our processes changed at that point. 
- [Template for the sample tube labels](https://github.com/arms-mbon/documentation/Templates/blob/main/ARMS_SampleLabelPrintoutExample_EMOBON_2023.docx). While the formatting of the IDs has changed since joining EMO BON, the template file itself should still be used.
- [Template for plate labels](https://github.com/arms-mbon/documentation/Templates/blob/main/ARMS_PlateLabelPrintoutExample.docx) (when photographing them). While the formatting of the IDs has changed since joining EMO BON, the template file itself should still be used.
- [Template for the Material Transfer Agreement](https://github.com/arms-mbon/documentation/Templates/blob/main/ARMS_MaterialTransferAgreement_2022-08-01.docx). It is no longer necessary to use this form to get your MTA, as we follow the EMO BON procedures now; this file is redundant, but we keep it here as a reference.

Also included are templates for
- [how to create your ARMS event and sampling IDs](https://github.com/arms-mbon/documentation/Templates/blob/main/CreatingARMSIDs.xlsx), based on your ARMS unit and observatory name and the sampling dates
- [how to describe your image files](https://github.com/arms-mbon/documentation/Templates/blob/main/ImagesDescriptionTemplate.csv) so that we can link them to the correct image fileIDs 
- [how to describe manual observations](https://github.com/arms-mbon/documentation/Templates/blob/main/ManualObservationsTemplate.csv) 

These particular files have now been updated to work with the IDs that are used by EMO BON.
