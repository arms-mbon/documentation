Here is the ARMS Data Management Plan<br>
- Source document, the "living" DMP which we update with time, can be found on https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aw4jp-a2r9908H9isXhdBkLW4VVLgdsMMUkIBNuS34k

As of the summer of 2022, ARMS-MBON became part of EMO BON, and as such the DMP of ARMS will be incorporated in that of [EMO BON](https://www.embrc.eu/emo-bon). The DMP provided here is valid for the ASSEMBLE Plus years of ARMS-MBON, that is for data that was collected up until the summer of 2022. However, while the ARMS-MBON and EMO BON DMPs are being merged and a new EMO BON DMP released, we will continue to add relevant information to the DMP here.
